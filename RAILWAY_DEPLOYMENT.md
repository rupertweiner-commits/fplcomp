# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## Why Railway Instead of Vercel?

Your FPL application is a **full-stack Node.js app** that requires:
- ✅ **Node.js runtime** (not just static files)
- ✅ **Database connections** (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
- ✅ **File system operations** (draft.json)
- ✅ **WebSocket support**
- ✅ **Environment variables**

Vercel only supports static sites and serverless functions, which is why you're getting 404 errors.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```

### Step 3: Initialize Project
```bash
railway init
```

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3000
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
railway variables set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

## 📁 Project Structure

Railway will automatically detect your Node.js app and:
- ✅ Install dependencies from `package.json`
- ✅ Run `npm start` command
- ✅ Handle environment variables
- ✅ Provide HTTPS and custom domains
- ✅ Auto-restart on failures

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't use Vercel (wrong platform)
- ❌ Don't use Netlify (static sites only)
- ❌ Don't use GitHub Pages (static sites only)

## ✅ What Railway Provides

- 🚀 **Automatic deployments** from Git
- 🔄 **Auto-restart** on crashes
- 📊 **Built-in monitoring**
- 🔒 **HTTPS by default**
- 🌐 **Custom domains**
- 💰 **Free tier available**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check `package.json` scripts

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
2. Check if database is accessible
3. Ensure firewall rules allow Railway IPs

### Port Issues
Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable. Your app should use:
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** using the steps above
2. **Test your app** at the Railway URL
3. **Set up custom domain** if needed
4. **Monitor performance** in Railway dashboard
