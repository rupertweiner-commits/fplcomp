## 🎮 **Chip Usage Mechanics**

### **Targeting System**
1. **Select Chip** - Choose from your inventory
2. **Choose Target** - Pick opponent from leaderboard
3. **Select Player** - Choose specific player (if required)
4. **Confirm Action** - Review and execute
5. **Notification** - Target player gets notified

### **Cooldown System**
- **Chip Cooldown**: 24 hours after use
- **Target Cooldown**: Can't target same player for 48 hours
- **Shield Cooldown**: 72 hours after use
- **Legendary Cooldown**: 1 week after use

### **Anti-Gaming Measures**
- **Position Lock**: Can't target players within 3 positions of you
- **Revenge Protection**: Can't target someone who just targeted you
- **Streak Bonus**: Consecutive days increase rare drop chances
- **Fair Play**: Admins can review and reverse unfair uses

## 🗄️ **Database Schema Updates**

### **Chip Effects Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE chip_effects (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  target_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  chip_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  effect_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  active_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Chip Notifications**
```sql
CREATE TABLE chip_notifications (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

  read_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
