4. **Collection** - Add to inventory with satisfying sound

### **Visual Elements**
- **Rarity Colors** - Gray (Common), Blue (Rare), Purple (Epic), Gold (Legendary)
- **Particle Effects** - Confetti, sparkles, glow effects
- **Sound Design** - Different sounds for each rarity tier
- **Collection Display** - Showcase of all owned chips

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema**

  effect_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- transfer_boost, points_multiplier, etc.
  effect_value JSONB NOT NULL, -- flexible effect parameters
  base_drop_rate DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **User Chip Inventory**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_chip_inventory (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  chip_definition_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES chip_definitions(id),
  quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  acquired_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  used_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Drop History**

  chip_definition_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES chip_definitions(id),
  leaderboard_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  drop_rate_modifier DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
